> Some Docker-composes & Dockerfiles I use for my projects

## About

I've decided to keep one day a repository where I could store the different Docker environments I've created or used during my different projects.

## Contributing

Everyone is free to add dockerfiles they have created in order to feed this resource, just be careful not to add duplicates.
